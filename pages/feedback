<td class="col-rep">Problems like this that are specific to /adv/ tend to be caused by ad blocker extensions because /adv/ is often used by other sites as an abbreviation for advertisement in their banner ad URLs. The ad blocker extension therefore inappropriately blocks functions of /adv/ that are completely unrelated to advertising. The solution is to create a whitelist rule for *.4chan.org and *.4cdn.org in your ad blocker extension.</td>

Is any anime reaction image an avatar? I&#039;m not asking to be unbanned, I would just like some clarity on this because I really don&#039;t understand when I&#039;m breaking the rule or not.</td>
<td class="col-rep">An avatar is a repetitive image or set of images that a user persistently attaches to their posts in an effort to uniquely identify themselves. Typically avatar users will have a folder full of images of a particular animated character with different poses and facial expressions, and they will choose images from this folder as a way of emoting their posts. In effect, they are attempting to post as if they were speaking as the character. If you are persistently attaching unrelated images of a particular character to your posts in an effort to uniquely identify yourself and roleplay as a character, then you are avataring.<br><br>This immediately lowers the level of discourse, and derails the thread to be about the avatar user instead of about the topic of discussion. This form of attention-whoring is not welcome on 4chan. If you absolutely must be uniquely identified, you can make use of the name field.</td>

<td class="col-msg"><h3>[Feedback] Policy Clarification on Foreign Languages and Possible Change</h3>Nowhere on the global or /mlp/ rules page does it specify which language posters must use in /mlp/. Recently, Spanish threads to discuss pony have been banned on /mlp/. They may have always been banned, but are only being deleted now. Several months ago, there were two /q/ posts by mods which indicated that Spanish threads to discuss the show were allowed. More recently, a mod on IRC said that those two posts are invalid, and clarified that Spanish threads are not allowed on /mlp/.<br><br>There have been rule clarifications by mods in the past, which still apply today (ban on Milky Way, Ass Worship, Fluffy Ponies). These rule clarifications are even referenced in rule 1 of /mlp/&#039;s rules. These rule clarifications were made at the same time it was clarified that Spanish threads are allowed. It seems that mod posts don&#039;t clearly determine what is and isn&#039;t allowed, and so the rules page should be updated.<br><br>It would be nice to allow the Spanish threads, because it isn&#039;t possible to discuss the show in /int/, so they would have nowhere to go.</td>
