</div>
<div class="boxcontent">
<dl>
<dt class="first" id="what4chan">What is 4chan?</dt>
<dd>
<p>4chan is a simple image-based bulletin board where anyone can
post comments and share images. 4chan's collaborative-community format
was inspired by one of the most popular forums in Japan, Futaba Channel.
Different boards are dedicated to different topics, from Japanese anime,
manga, and culture to videogames, music, and photography. Users do not
need to register an account before participating in the community.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="howaccess">How do I access the boards?</dt>
<dd>
<p>In order to access the full site, you must first read and
agree to the terms of the disclaimer. To access the disclaimer
simply click any board and a dialogue will appear. Your response will be
cookied so you'll only need to do this once (providing you don't clear your
cache/cookies afterwards). If you wish to browse the site using frames, visit
/<a href="/frames">frames</a>.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="whatbasics">What should I know before I post?</dt>
<dd>
<p>Users are encouraged to participate actively in our community,
but only after they have familiarized themselves with the <a href="/rules">rules</a> and this FAQ. Breaking the rules may
result in post deletion, a temporary ban, or in some cases,
permanent banishment. <em>Understand the rules before you begin
posting!</em></p>
</dd>
<dt id="postanon">How do I post anonymously?</dt>
<dd>
<p>To post as "Anonymous", simply do not fill in the [Name] field
when submitting content. Information such as your personal IP
address is viewable only to the administrators, and is not made
publicly available.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="register">Can I register a username?</dt>
<dd>
<p>No user registration process is available. If you're worried
about somebody impersonating you, consider using a <a href="#tripcode">tripcode</a> to help validate your identity.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="postimage">Must I post an image?</dt>
<dd>
<p>To start a new thread, you must upload an image. 4chan
<em>is</em> primarily an <strong>image</strong>board after all!
When replying to an already existing thread, no attachment is
required.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="replyimage">Can I reply with an image?</dt>
<dd>
<p>Yes. To reply to a thread with an image of your own, click the
[Reply] link and fill in the post box as you normally would, making
sure to specify an image for attachment.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="quote">How do I quote somebody?</dt>
<dd>
<p>To quote a portion of text, simply place a pointer ("&gt;") in
front of the text you wish to highlight (ex. "<span style="color:#789922">&gt;This is a quote</span>"). To link to and
highlight an entire post, place two pointers in front of its unique
post number (ex. "<span style="color:#000080">&gt;&gt;210981</span>"). Cross-linking to
another 4chan board is also possible, by placing three pointers
before a board letter, followed by a post number (ex. "<span style="color:#000080">&gt;&gt;&gt;/x/1208196</span>").</p><br/>
<p>If you're using our <a href="#extension">inline extension</a>, simply
click the post number you'd like to reference and it will bring up a Quick Reply
window for you to write your response in. Highlighting text and then clicking the
post number will quote the selected text.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="spoiler">Can I mark a submission as a spoiler?</dt>
<dd>
<p>Only certain boards allow you to mask plot-spoiling content. To
mark your image as a spoiler, check the [x Spoiler Image?] box
before submission. Spoilerizing text makes it unreadable to others
until they mouse over it. To spoilerize a comment, place [spoiler]
tags around the text you wish to hide (ex. "[spoiler]SPIKE
DIES![/spoiler]"). Misuse of these tags may result in a ban.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="trip">How do I use a "tripcode"?</dt>
<dd>
<p>Tripcodes can help verify a user's identity to others, and are a
type of <em>pseudo</em>-registration. To use a normal tripcode,
place a hash mark ("#") followed by a word or short phrase after
what you've entered into the [Name] field (ex. "User#password").
Upon submission, the server will generate the hash unique to that
particular word or phrase. The previous example would display
"<span style="color:#000080"><strong>User</strong>
!ozOtJW9BFA</span>" after being posted.</p><br/>
<p><strong>Important note:</strong> A tripcode is generated only
using the text entered after the hash mark. Your entered name, IP
address, cookie information, etc. do not affect the output. Normal
tripcodes are <em>not</em> secure, and can be cracked with relative ease.
For a more secure solution, see <a href="#sectrip">secure
tripcodes</a>.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="sectrip">What is a "secure tripcode"?</dt>
<dd>
<p>A <em>secure</em> tripcode can be generated by placing two
hash marks in the [Name] field, as opposed to one as with a
<em>normal</em> tripcode (ex. "User##password"). Secure tripcodes
use a secret key file on the server to help obscure their password.
The previous example would display "<span style="color:#000080"><strong>User</strong> !!rEkSWzi2+mz</span>"
after being posted.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="capcode">What is a capcode?</dt>
<dd>
<p>A capcode is a way of verifying someone as a 4chan team member.
Normal users do not have the ability to post using a capcode. A <a href="#whomod">moderator</a> capcode will display "<span style="color:#800080"><strong>## Mod
<img src="//s.4cdn.org/image/modicon.gif" alt="Mod Icon" title="This user is a 4chan Moderator." style="margin-bottom: -3px;"/></strong></span>"
after their name. Similarly, the <a href="#whoadmin">administrator</a> capcode
displays "<span style="color:#FF0000"><strong>## Admin <img src="//s.4cdn.org/image/adminicon.gif" alt="Admin Icon" title="This user is the 4chan Administrator." style="margin-bottom: -3px;"/></strong></span>".
Often times, a moderator will post as
"<span style="color:#800080"><strong>Anonymous ##
Mod <img src="//s.4cdn.org/image/modicon.gif" alt="Mod Icon" title="This user is a 4chan Moderator." style="margin-bottom: -3px;"/></strong></span>" in order to keep their identity secret (which
is policy). <a href="#whojan">Janitors</a> do not receive a
capcode.</p><br/>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Icons will always appear alongside a capcode, and will display a tooltip that says "This user is a/the 4chan Moderator/Administrator" upon mousing over them. If there is no icon/tooltip, the poster is
an impersonator.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="sage">What is "sage"?</dt>
<dd>
<p>Entering "sage" (by itself) into the [Options] field while
replying will cause the thread not to bump to the top of the page.
Contrary to popular belief, a sage is not a downvote, and should not be used as one. "sage-bombing" or
announcing that you've saged a thread may result in a ban.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="nonoko">How can I be returned to the board index after I post?</dt>
<dd>
<p>In August 2012 the default behavior of posting was changed. Upon posting users
are redirected to their post instead of the board index. To enable the legacy behavior of being
returned to the board index after posting, enter "nonoko" into the [Options] field.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="nonokosage">Can I use nonoko and sage at the same time?</dt>
<dd>
<p>Yes, enter "nonokosage" into the [Options] field.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="report">How do I report posts?</dt>
<dd>
<p>Reporting posts for review is extremely encouraged, as it helps us remove rule breaking and/or illegal content faster. To file a report, click the "&#9654;" button to the right of the post number to expand the post menu, and then select the "Report post" option. A confirmation dialogue will pop up and ask if the post you are reporting is a rule violation, spam, or if it contains illegal material. Be sure to mark this appropriately! Fill out the captcha, and then click on the Submit button.</p><br/>
<p><strong>Important note:</strong> Submitting intentionally false reports may result in a ban. This policy is in place to discourage abuse of the system; it is not meant to dissuade users from submitting legitimate reports.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="delete">How do I delete my own post(s)?</dt>
<dd>
<p>When you submit a post, a password cookie is automatically set that will
allow you to delete your post should you choose to. As long as your browser retains this cookie, you
will be able to delete posts made using it. To delete your post(s), check the box in the upper
lefthand corner of the specific post(s) you wish to remove, and
scroll down to the bottom of the page and click the [Delete]
button on the right. Checking the [x File Only] box will cause only the image to be
deleted, leaving the comment untouched. Note that some boards and threads
(ex. stickies) do not allow a user to delete their posts.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="bump">Why won't my thread bump?</dt>
<dd>
<p>All threads have a set bump limit (varies board to board). When
this limit is reached, a thread will no longer "bump" to the top of
the board, causing the thread to descend through the pages until it
is bumped off of the last page and pruned. This method of post-limiting,
while sometimes inconvenient, assures that content is kept fresh on
the boards.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="worksafe">What does "work safe" mean?</dt>
<dd>
<p>"Work safe" is defined as "content that is safe for viewing in
the average working environment." Boards that default to the Yotsuba B or
Burichan (blue) theme are to be considered work safe. Posting
content that is not suitable for this environment may result in a
ban. The goal behind enforcing this rule is to keep the cleaner
sections of the site accessible to those in restricted viewing
situations.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="prunedelete">My post disappeared! Where'd it go?</dt>
<dd>
<p>Threads expire and are pruned by 4chan's software at a
relatively high rate. Since most boards are limited to ten
pages, content is usually available for only a few hours or days before
it is removed. Most times, the post was probably pruned automatically, however in some cases it
may have been removed by a moderator or janitor.
We ask that users refrain from reposting material that they believe
to have been deleted by the moderators.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="archive">Can I retrieve an old post/image?</dt>
<dd>
<p>No. Content that has expired is removed from our servers. Please do not contact us requesting
content that has been pruned, for it is impossible for us to assist
you. Instead, try placing a request on the /<a href="//boards.4chan.org/r/" title="Request">r</a>/
board.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="usercontact">Can you help me contact a specific user?</dt>
<dd>
<p>No. Unless a user elects to include an e-mail address or other contact information in their
post, there is no way to contact that user privately. More details regarding our storage of personal
information can be found <a href="#personalinfo">here</a>.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="imagesource">How can I find the source of an image?</dt>
<dd class="last">
<p>Google Image Search and iqdb are great resources to identify the source of an image.
You can access these services using our inline extension by clicking the "&#9654;" button to the right of a post containing an image, and then selecting "Image search". Remember: Posting requests for source information on the boards may get you banned&mdash;use /<a href="//boards.4chan.org/r/" title="Requests" target="_blank">r</a>/ for all requests.</p>

<dt class="first" id="anonymous">Who is "Anonymous"?</dt>
<dd>
<p>"Anonymous" is the name assigned to a poster who does not enter
text in to the [Name] field. Anonymous is not a single person, but
rather, represents the collective whole of 4chan. He is a god amongst
men. Anonymous invented the moon, assassinated former President
David Palmer, and is also harder than the hardest metal known the
man: diamond. His power level is rumored to be over nine thousand.
He currently resides with his auntie and uncle in a town called
Bel-Air (however, he is West Philadelphia born and raised). He does
not forgive.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="meme">What is a "meme"?</dt>
<dd>
<p>A meme is basically an idea that is easily transferable from one
mind to another. Think "catchphrases." Memes are created when a
large group of users come to identify with a particular image or
slogan. Their continued [mis]use will bring about the destruction
of the universe.</p>

<p>"GETs" happen on the approach to significant or unique post
numbers on a board, usually /<a href="//boards.4chan.org/b/" title="Random">b</a>/
(ex. "5MGET", "1234567GET", "7777777GET", etc.). GETs are sought
after by many, and normally thousands of users will compete
for one, often posting very quickly in order to better their
chances of achieving the desired GET number. GETs are no longer
automatically "<a href="#sticky">stickied</a>." This feature was
disabled due to some alleging that the moderation team was rigging
them behind the scenes. That, and because GETs tend to implode on
themselves within minutes of being posted.</p>

<dt class="first" id="contribwhat">What is considered positive contribution?</dt>
<dd>
<p>Our definition of "positive contribution" is the submission of
substantial, helpful, friendly, and humorous posts to the boards,
along with the uploading of quality images and files. We feel that
positive contribution should be treated as a way of donating to
4chan without actually having to fork over cash.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="contribwhy">Why is contribution so important?</dt>
<dd>
<p>Contribution is important because it is what <em>drives</em>
this website. If we didn't have a dedicated pool of users who
frequently contribute, we'd be yet another stagnant run of the mill
forum. But we aren't. By having an increasing number of diverse and
quality contributors, 4chan becomes more unique, interesting, and
enjoyable to use.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="contribhow">How can I become a good contributor?</dt>
<dd>
<p>It's really quite easy. If you have something to add to a topic:
reply. If you have an interesting, high quality, neat, rare, etc.
picture: upload it! Share your mind and image collections with us.
Don't just leech! Give back to the community which you take from.

<dt id="trial">What is a trial board?</dt>
<dd>
<p>Trial boards are added every now and then to broaden the scope
of the website. We open new trial boards as resources permit, based
on requests from the userbase. If a board does not perform well, it
is removed to make way for others. A board's trial status is
denoted by its name appearing <em>italicized</em> on the navigation
menu.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="addx">Can you add "<em>x</em>" board?</dt>
<dd class="last">
<p>Short answer: no. Long answer: maybe. Boards are added only if
we believe there is enough interest to drive quality traffic to
them.</p>

<dd>
<p><a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAPTCHA" target="_blank">CAPTCHA</a> is an effective means to mitigate
automated spam and ensure a submission is coming from a real person.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="whycaptcha">Why does 4chan use CAPTCHA?</dt>
<dd>
<p>CAPTCHA was implemented on the imageboards to deal with a deluge of automated spam some years ago.
It has proven effective in reducing the amount of automated spam that appears on the site.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="whyspam">Why do I still see spam on the boards?</dt>
<dd>
<p>CAPTCHA is not 100% foolproof. Many spammers will pre-fill CAPTCHAs or pay CAPTCHA solving teams
(actual people to sit around and fill out challenges) to spam manually. Spam that is not caught by CAPTCHA
should be <a href="#report">reported</a> and it will be removed by the moderation team.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="whencaptcha">When will the CAPTCHA be removed?</dt>
<dd>
<p>Unfortunately, CAPTCHA is a permanent addition to the site. Despite its shortcomings, it is extremely
effective at reducing automated spam and without it the site would be awash with spam.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="nocaptcha">Is there any way to post without a CAPTCHA?</dt>

<p>Users who purchase a <a href="https://www.4chan.org/pass" target="_blank">4chan Pass</a> may post and report posts without typing a CAPTCHA verification.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="xbroken">Why doesn't "x" work properly?</dt>
<dd>
<p>Here are four common solutions to problems users might experience:</p>
<ol>
<li>Enable first &amp; third party cookies.</li>
<li>Enable JavaScript.</li>
<li>Don't block HTTP referers.</li>
<li>Whitelist 4chan.org and all of its subdomains.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dt id="spampost">Why does 4chan think my post is spam?</dt>
<dd>
<p>If 4chan's servers detect that you have JavaScript and cookies enabled, but not HTTP referers, you will receive the following error when attempting to post:</p><br/>
<p>"Detected JavaScript + cookies + blocked referer. Your post looks like spam this way, so either enable referers or disable JavaScript and cookies."</p><br/>
<p>Follow the instructions given and either enable HTTP referers, or disable JavaScript and cookies. Read <a href="#xbroken">above</a> for more ideas.</p><br/>
<p>In addition, 4chan maintains a list of blocked URLs and keywords that may result in your post being rejected.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="noref">What's this "4chan.org" image?</dt>
<dd>
<p>If a black and white "4chan.org"
<a href="//s.4cdn.org/image/4chan-leech.png">image</a> is
being displayed instead of thumbnails, your browser/firewall/proxy is
blocking the transmission of HTTP referers, which is triggering our anti-leech
filter. Disable anything that might be blocking your browser's
referer from being sent to our servers, and refresh the page.</p>

<dt id="whofounder">Who founded 4chan?</dt>

<p>Christopher "moot" Poole founded and served as the founding administrator of 4chan for more than eleven years, from October 2003 until January 2015.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="whomod">Who are the moderators?</dt>
<dd>
<p>Moderators are individuals selected to perform general site
maintenance. They may delete posts globally, ban users, sticky and
close threads, etc. There is no publicly available list of
moderators. Since 4chan is primarily an <em>anonymous</em>
website, the moderators abide by that same mindset.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="whojan">What are "janitors"?</dt>
<dd>
<p>"Janitors" are a class between "end user" and "moderator." They
are given access to the report system and may delete posts on their
assigned board(s), as well as submit ban requests. Janitors are
selected via an application, orientation, and testing process.
Janitors are instructed to not reveal their position to others and
are to conduct themselves as would be expected of any other user. A
breach in confidentiality is grounds for immediate expulsion from
the program.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="moderation">I never see proof of moderation! Why?</dt>
<dd>
<p>...Why would you? There is no public record of deletion, and
since threads are frequently pruned, there is no way of knowing
which have been removed by the moderation team. The "<span style="color:red"><strong>(USER WAS BANNED FOR THIS
POST)</strong></span>" message is optional and only used under
certain circumstances, so it's not a good indication of how
frequently users are being banned. Usually when a user is banned,
their posts are removed because they're in violation of the rules!
Quite simply, <em>there is no way for an end user to accurately
judge the amount of moderation taking place at any given point in
time</em>. Rest assured though; the moderators and janitors are
always working hard to do their best and keep the boards free of
rule breaking content.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="volunteer">Can I volunteer to join the team?</dt>
<dd class="last">
<p>Yes and no. Admission to the moderation team is by invite only.
<em>Period</em>. The janitor program is occasionally opened up to
new applicants. Watch the global message and blotter for notices
concerning the application process. If there is no advertised
janitor recruitment going on, <strong>you're out of luck</strong>.
Be patient!</p>

<p>If you're banned you will be redirected to
<strong>https://www.4chan.org/banned</strong> when trying to
post on the board(s) you're banned from. If you're getting 403 or
404 errors, this doesn't necessarily mean you're banned.</p>

<dt id="banappeal">Can I appeal my ban?</dt>

<p>Yes. Use the embedded appeal tool on the banned page to appeal your
ban. <em>Read the entire banned page carefully before disputing your ban</em>.
Note that some bans require you sit out for a few days before allowing you to appeal the
ban. If you believe an error has been made, or you are being mistakenly
affected by a ban meant for somebody else, contact a moderator on IRC at
<a href="irc://irc.rizon.net/4chan">#4chan @ Rizon</a>. Moderators are available to assist users with bans and technical issues on the website. PM a moderator (operators in the channel denoted by @ or % symbols before their name) with all relevant information, including your IP address if banned.

</dd>
<dt id="tempblock">Why am I temporarily blocked from posting?</dt>
<dd>
<p>Users are temporarily blocked from posting when there is a pending ban request placed on their IP. This block lasts 15 minutes from the time a janitor submits
a ban request, and is removed immediately if the request is denied by a moderator. If the request is approved, a regular ban is applied.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="blocked">Which ISPs, IP ranges, and countries are blocked from posting?</dt>
<dd class="last">
<p>A number of ISPs, IP ranges, and countries are disallowed from posting.
These blocks stem from repeated abuse coming from these ISPs/IP ranges/countries. 4chan Pass users are exempt from these blocks (but <em>not</em> <a href="#banknow">individual bans</a>)&mdash;<a href="https://www.4chan.org/pass">click here to learn more</a>.</p>

<dt class="first" id="open">When did 4chan open?</dt>
<dd>
<p>4chan opened to the public on October 1st, 2003. Actually, it
opened a few days earlier but had no site structure and wasn't
using the 4chan domain name, so 10/01/03 (the date of the first
news post) is the officially recognized birth date.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="start">How did it all start?</dt>
<dd>
<p>4chan was started as a project by Christopher "moot" Poole, a user of a small IRC/DC
community known as Raspberry Heaven, which was [then] composed of
users from the "Anime Death Tentacle Rape Whorehouse" (ADTRW)
sub-forum of The Something Awful Forums. The site began as a small
image dump for those communities that soon spread like wildfire and
garnered enough traffic and popularity to become its own fully
fledged community.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="were">What were 4channel and world4ch?</dt>
<dd>
<p>4channel and world4ch were two sites spun off from 4chan but
later merged back into the main site. 4channel was basically "work
safe 4chan", and world4ch housed our discussion boards.</p>

<dt id="sponsor">Does 4chan sponsor third-party projects?</dt>

<p>4chan generally does not endorse third-party projects. Please do
not market your project as "official" or "sponsored" by 4chan, or
